# Scheduling Problem for Roadef 
This repository contains a Python program designed for scheduling sessions for the ROADEF 2024 conference. The program encodes the  problem into Maximum Satisfiability (Max-SAT) , which can be then solved through dedicated solvers to efficiently allocate sessions while minimising working-group conflicts. 

# Install Required Packages
Before running the program, ensure you have Python 3 and pip installed on your system and install the NumPy and PySAT packages:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install python-sat[pblib,aiger]

```
